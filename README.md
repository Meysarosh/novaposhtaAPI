Use of NovaPoshta's api (delivery company) in a online shop

This project contains an example of online shop and use of a delivery company's API. (in this case I'm using the most popular and most effective delivery company in Ukraine "NovaPoshta")
The main goal is that the buyer can choose a delivery adress(wharehouse), recive estimated delivery date and delivery cost while ordering from online shop.
List of delivery adresses (city, number and adress of wharehouse or buyers adress), delivery cost, estimated delivery date will be imported/calculated by delivery company API's and response will be shown to the buyer.
If the seller (owner of online shop) inserts it's API key(requestable in users account settings), it will be possible, that after confirmation of order the parcel number will be  automaticaly generated (of corse with the delivery company's API) and buyer instantly will recive in confirmation.
